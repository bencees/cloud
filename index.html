        <h3>Finding the job that pay the highest</h3>
        
        <p>This project serves to source which job has the highest monetary prospect in Europe. Data was sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/job-salary-prediction/data">Kaggle</a> and used to compile a list of 1.04 million rows. As about 100,000 records will be cut off when the data is opened using Microsoft Excel, we are required to host the data through a cloud providing platform, namely, Dropbox and Amazon Web Service.  </p>

<p>Data: Raw data consisting of 1.04 million rows, with categories of ID, Title, Location, Contract Type, Company, Industry and Salary. </br>
  Bootstrap: <a href="http://misoproject.com/">Miso Project </a>API was used in utilizing the Bootstraping functionality and CSS. 
  </br>Duplication: To reduce the large data set, Mapreduce was used where each key | value represents the ID | Salary. To remove duplication, each colum was fit into an array and iterated. Each itereation adds IDs into new arrays and duplicates are not added. 
  </br> Analysis: Salary, Company and Title columns are taken and sorted, with the highest salary are at the top and the rest are at the bottom.
